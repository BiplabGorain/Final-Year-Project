Then reduce to low. Now this is what will happen as the butter slowly simmers. Moisture will be evaporated out of the ghee. The white protein-solids from the butter will sink down to the bottom of the pan and slowly turn golden. A foam will rise to the surface, and as it cooks will form a bit of a crust. The butter will cook into a gold color as well, and it will have a slightly nutty smell. When the moisture is gone, the ghee is done. Decant the oil and save the delicious golden buttery bits on the bottom of the pan for toast, or mixed with veggies or potatoes. If you've used salted butter, you don't want to use it on toast- the salt will knock you out, but it's still good in potatoes or whatnot.\nMaking the Scented Syrup: Combine sugar and water and bring to a boil for 3 minutes. Remove from heat and add rose water or essence.\nTraditional Method: Use a heavy-bottomed pan because the milk will stick. Use a non-stick pot if you have it. Boil the milk down over medium heat, while stirring,  until it forms a paste.  Add the flour and mix into a smooth paste. Oil your hands and roll them into uniform balls, place them onto a buttered plate and set aside.\nPowdered-Milk Method: Combine the warm milk and ghee together. Mix the powdered milk and flour together and sprinkle slowly into the wet mix to form a dough. Oil your hands and form uniform balls (about 24) and set aside on a buttered plate.\nCooking the jamuns:\nThis is the most delicate part of the operation. Gentle, low heat is a must. Use a wok or karai for best results, with the ghee about 2.5-3 inches in depth.\nHeat the ghee on low to 215 degrees.\nSlip in the balls, one by one. They will sink. No touching at this point.\nGently shake the pan to move the balls and keep them from getting too brown on one side. After about 5 minutes they will begin to float. You will notice them getting bigger.\nNow, use a wooden spoon or equivalent to gently agitate and keep them evenly browning.\nThe ghee will slowly get hotter as the balls cook.\nAfter about 20 minutes, the ghee will have risen in temperature to around 245 degrees and the balls should be nice and golden.\nRemove a ball and put it in the syrup. If it doesn't collapse after 3 minutes, remove the others and add to the syrup.\nIf it does collapse, fry for another 5 minutes and try again.\nLet soak for 2 hours at least before serving.\nServe room temperature or warmed up.\nEnjoy your gulab jamuns!\n"}, {"name": "haldi doodh", "cooking_time": "10mins", "calories": "Calories: 5.3", "ingredients": " 1       tea cup boiled milk\n 1    teaspoon    haldi powder (turmeric)\n 1\u20442   teaspoon   freshly ground black pepper\n", "directions": "Boil the milk.\nSwitch off the flame and add the turmeric and pepper.\nDrink it while it is very hot.\nNote: this can be consumed morning and night.\nCare: remain warm after consuming this at night.

Heat the oven to 350? F. Spray the bottoms of two 9-inch round cake pans with nonstick cooking spray or lightly butter them. Line the bottoms with parchment rounds. Spray or butter the paper rounds and dust the pans with 1 tablespoon of flour each. Invert the pans and bang them out over the sink to remove excess flour.\nMake your mango reduction by simmering the cup of Alphonso mango puree for about 25 minutes until it is reduced by \u00bc of its original volume. when reduced remove from heat, allow to cool then chill while you make the cake.\nUsing a fork, mix the milk, egg whites, orange flower water, and vanilla extract in a bowl until well combined.\nAdd the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and cardamom to the bowl of a stand mixer or a large mixing bowl. Using your thumb and forefinger, crush the saffron threads over the bowl. Using the paddle attachment (if using a stand mixer), blend the dry ingredients at low speed for about 5 seconds. Add the butter and beat at low speed until the mixture resembles moist crumbs, about 1 \u00bd minutes.\nAdd all but \u00bd cup of the wet ingredients and mix at medium speed (6 on a stand mixer, or high speed with a handheld mixer) for 1 \u00bd minutes. Add the remaining mixture and beat for another 30 seconds. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and beat for another 20 seconds.\nDivide the batter between the two pans and spread it out to the walls and smooth out the tops. Bang the pans against the counter a few times to even out the batter.\nArrange the pans on the oven rack so that there is at least 3 inches of space around each pan (this allows for proper air circulation and even baking). Bake for 23-25 minutes; a toothpick should come out clean.\nLet the cakes cool in the pans for 5 minutes, then invert them onto a plate and then onto a cooling rack. Let the cakes cool completely before frosting.\nAfter the cakes are done, spread the pistachios on a baking sheet and bake them at 350? F for 3-4 minutes to lightly toast them.\nWhen the nuts are cool, place them in a plastic bag and lightly crush them. Reserve 2 tablespoons of the crushed nuts for the top of the cake. (Optional: toss them with a small amount of green luster dust.).\nMake the frosting:\nBring 2 inches of water to a boil in large pot. Reduce the heat so that the water is simmering.\nPut the egg whites and sugar in the bowl of a standing mixer. Place this bowl on top of the pot of simmering water. Whisk the mixture for 1 \u00bd - 2 minutes \u2013 it will turn frothy and then white. (This is done to heat the egg whites and kill any bacteria that may be present and to dissolve the sugar.).\nTransfer the bowl to a standing mixer. Using the whisk attachment, mix on high speed (10) until the whites are thick and glossy and the bowl is cool \u2013 this will take about 8 minutes.\nAdd the butter one piece at a time, waiting a few seconds between each addition. (The frosting may appear curdled when you have added about 2 sticks of butter, but ignore that and just keep adding the butter \u2013 it will get smooth again.).\nAdd the mango reduction and beat until fully incorporated. Reserve \u00bd cup of frosting in a piping bag.\nAssemble the cake:\nUsing a serrated knife or cake trimmer, level the tops of the cakes. (This recipe produced a pretty flat cake \u2013 very little doming \u2013 so I didn\u2019t have to cut too much off.).\nPlace one cake cut side down (bottom facing up) on a cake platter or serving plate. (Before doing this, put 3\" x 2\" strips of foil or waxed paper around the edge of the plate, then put the cake on top \u2013 this will keep your serving plate clean.).\nSpread \u00be cup of the frosting on the cake and spread it out evenly. Sprinkle the crushed pistachios onto the frosting.\nPlace the second cake, cut side down, on top of the frosted layer. Spread about \u00bd cup of frosting on top and spread it out in a very thin layer along the top and sides of the cake, using more if necessary. (This is called the crumb coat \u2013 it traps any crumbs that come loose from the cake so that the final layer of frosting is clean.).\nRefrigerate the cake until the frosting is hard, about 30-40 minutes.\nSpread the remaining frosting on the top and sides of the cake to form a smooth, even layer.\nUsing the reserved frosting, pipe stars onto the border of the cake. (On the first cake, make just one row of large stars using. On the second cake, make three rows.\nSprinkle the reserved pistachios in a circle in the center of the cake.

It should look like bread crumbs. \r\nMake a firm dough, adding a little water at a time. I tend to make mine in a food processor these days. If making by hand, knead it well. \r\nKeep aside for 20 minutes and then knead again, until smooth. \r\nMaking Samosas: \r\nMake a little glue by adding 2-3 tbs. water to 1 tbs. of plain flour and mixing to a thick liquid. Keep aside. \r\nDivide the dough into 8-9 portions and make balls, using greased hands. Keep covered with a moist muslin/handkerchief or 'j' cloth. \r\nMix 1 teaspoons flour with 2 tbs. water, to make a 'glue' Keep it aside. \r\nRoll out one ball at a time on a greased surface, into an 7-8 inch circle/chapatti, approximately 2-3 mm thick. Cut it into half using a knife. You now have 2 half circles \r\nLift one half in your palm and bring edges together, overlapping one over the other, making a cone. \r\nBrush a little glue on one of the overlapping edges and press the other edge over it gently with a 4-5 mm. overlap, to give the cone a good seal. If not sealed properly, it opens up during frying. \r\nNow fill one cone with approximately 2 tbs. of the potato mix. You should have enough edge left at the top (4-5 mm.) to get a good seal. Using 'glue', press and seal the top edges together. \r\nMake all samosas like this. Keep them covered with a moist cloth. If pastry is allowed to dry, it is more likely to burst during frying. \r\nHeat the oil in a wok or karahi to medium heat. If the oil is too hot, samosas will be soggy and not crisp. Oil should not be 'smoking'. Test by putting a small piece of dough into it, it should sizzle and rise gently to the top. \r\nPut as many samosa as will spread out easily in your wok and fry gently to golden brown. ( do not over fill as this can cause the oil to cool and it will make your samosa greasy) Turn them over gently a few times to ensure even browning. Take out and place on kitchen paper, to absorb surplus oil. \r\nServe hot with Green Mango Chutney or Tomato Ketchup.\n"}, {"name": "vegetarian cake", "cooking_time": "55mins", "calories": "Calories: 272.8", "ingredients": " 1    cup    semolina\n 1    cup    sugar\n 1    cup    curds\n 1    teaspoon    baking soda\n 4    tablespoons   melted oil\n 1    teaspoon    vanilla essence\n 4   cardamoms (powdered)\n 4    tablespoons   chopped nuts\n 10 -15   raisins\n", "directions": "Mix semolina, sugar and curd.\nStir well.\nAdd raisins, nuts, powdered cardamom and vanilla essence.\nPre-heat oven to 300 degrees Fahrenhit.\nGrease a medium size pan with butter.\nPour in the mixture and bake for 30-45 minutes.\n"}, {"name": "vellore style chicken biriyani", "cooking_time": "40mins", "calories": "Calories: 905.2", "ingredients": " 1    kg    chicken, cut into medium sized pieces \n 1    teaspoon    salt\n 2    teaspoons    ginger-garlic paste\n 1\u20442   teaspoon    turmeric powder\n 3\u20444   teaspoon    chili powder\n 3    cups    basmati rice\n 1    cup    water, lukewarm \n 5    tablespoons    olive oil\n 6   onions, thinly sliced \n 1   cinnamon stick\n 5   cloves\n 10   cashews, halved \n 1    tablespoon    ginger paste\n 1    tablespoon    garlic paste\n 3   cardamom pods\n 2 -3   bay leaves (optional)\n 2    tablespoons    mint leaves, chopped \n 6    tablespoons    coriander leaves, chopped \n 1    teaspoon    chili powder\n 1    teaspoon    coriander powder\n 4   tomatoes, chopped \n 1    teaspoon    salt\n 1    cup    yoghurt, beaten well \n", "directions": "Mix the chicken with salt, ginger, garlic paste, turmeric powder, chillie powder.
